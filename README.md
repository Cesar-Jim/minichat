## **Improvements still needed:**
   1. Clear the textbox after sending a message
   2. Create a second interface to avoid having to switch the user before sending a message
   3. Beautify the interface by making use of Bootstrap (at least)
   4. Mimic some *Whatsapp* features and include more functionality
   5. Include more integration and unit testing
   6. Although the project structure is ok, it could still be refined
