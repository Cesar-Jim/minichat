## **Improvements still needed:**

1.  Clear the textbox after sending a message
2.  Create a second interface to avoid having to switch the user before sending a message
3.  Beautify the interface by making use of Bootstrap (at least)
4.  Mimic some _Whatsapp_ features and include more functionality
5.  Include more integration and unit testing
6.  Although the project structure is ok, it could still be refined
